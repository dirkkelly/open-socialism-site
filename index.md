# Welcome To Open Socialism

Open Socialism is societal system designed to be the best possible system given our current level of scientific knowledge and  technology. It takes the best parts from communism, socialism, capitalism, democracy and a variety of other sources and offers a new and ultimately radically different system for society than the currently popular democratic capitalism (DC).

DC as a system has served humanity well for a period of time and there has been great technological development. However, it is outgrowing its usefulness as recurring problems of wealth inequality and financial crisis worsen. Now that we have advanced so far with the internet and modern business we have the tools to create much superior systems that are equitable for everyone in society and greatly productive.

Changing from DC is going to be difficult as we have individuals with extreme wealth and power who don't want to change. Having said that, as wealth and power inequality continues to worsen changing will become increasingly difficult. It is time to start talking and working towards better alternatives lest change never be possible.
