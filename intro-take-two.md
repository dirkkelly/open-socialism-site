## What is 'Open Socialism'?

Open Socialism is a system that is designed to be the most equitable and productive societal system given our current level of scientific and technological advancement.

Before we get into the specifics, let's look at the history of human societies and look at the recurring problems. Let's in particular look at democratic capitalism (DC) and show that whilst it has achieved a lot and it does have good parts, it is not terribly different from systems that have come before it that favor a ruling class. Let's then look into how we can take the good parts from DC and a variety of other systems and create a societal system that is far better for the vast majority of the population.

## A History of Human Societies

### The Nomadic Tribe

About 200,000 years ago modern humans evolved from primates.

Humans lived in nomadic tribes. Everyone basically had the same job of hunting and gathering. Whilst some individuals might be leadership figures of a tribe they did not dominate others in the tribe and each individual got a relatively even share of the tribes resources.

Tribes were closely bonded kin and each individual had a strong sense of belonging and community in their tribe. This is because tribes that worked together and cooperated were selected via the process of natural selection.

It is important to note that physiologically we have not significantly changed from those humans of old. We are still the same humans that if raised in a tribal would fit perfectly into it. This is a society in which our natural instincts and ways of organizing ourselves suit the environment perfectly. There is leadership based on merit, small wealth and power inequality and a strong sense of community. In a sense it is the perfect society for us, however it is not feasible on a global scale at the level of population the earth now has.

Why do such societies so perfectly fit our psychology? The main reason is our own self interest almost perfectly aligns with the interest of our tribe. If in this environment we took a capitalistic approach and hoarded our own food we would be shunned and expelled (or worse). A bunch of humans working for themselves is less productive than humans working together (and by extension for themselves at the same). Being valuable to your tribe, providing good leadership, all these things help yourself and your tribe at the same time. This is why the tribal system is so good and why our ancestors who worked together were selected by natural selection.

Not only is this working together more effective, it is also hard wired into our psychology and cooperation, belonging to a tribe is tremendously satisfying and ultimately a strong need of ours.

### Agricultural Societies

7000 years ago agriculture was achieved which greatly changed human societies. Firstly lets note that this is only in the last 3.5% of human history. The prior 96.5% was the tribal cooperative system.

For the first time humans had the the ability to stay in one place as they could utilize the land efficiently enough to produce sufficient food for everyone. Agriculture also meant that not everyone had to focus on the necessities of survival since the farmers could produce a great amount of food. This meant that other more specialized forms of technological development and wealth generation could exist. For the first time significant wealth generation and accumulation was possible.

As technology advanced and the ability to accumulate wealth increased leaders rose to the top. We progressed to the system of society that has been recurring throughout history with different classes including a ruling class.

The reason this happened is that humans are actually self interested above all else. Humans that have not favored themselves primarily have not been selected by evolution since this kind of selfishness greatly increases the chance of an individuals genes being passed on. However, pre agriculture it wasn't a problem as there was only so much room for selfishness. We pretty much had to be highly cooperative with the tribe or we risk being ostracized which likely means death. The wiggle room was being more prominent in the tribe and attracting mates. If a member can be selfish in these ways then that is acceptable (and the competition and striving is actually good for the tribe anyway).

Since agriculture and commerce the tribal system collapsed and we were suddenly living with a new system. For the first time an individual could be greatly selfish and not only not get ostracized but could prosper, be celebrated, become powerful and be a ruler of society. This is the same humans exercising the same selfishness. The difference is that the system of society had changed and the natural urge for selfishness was no longer held in check by the nature of a tribal society and also by necessity (a tribe of selfish members was not strong enough to survive).

However, the selfish system of individuals is less productive, less satisfying and is analogous to candy. Similarly to how when our environment limits our intake of sweets and survival is tough sweet foods are great because they have a lot of energy. Although nowadays we have endless access to cheap candy and struggle to fight our instincts to over consume. The tribal environment no longer exists and our selfish instincts hurt us (as we become lonely loners) and hurt society with decreased productivity.

One core metric of a society is to what degree does selfish human behavior coincide with the greater good. The tribal system was almost perfect. Since then there hasn't been a society that has been remotely close. What we have had since then is the class based system.

### The Class System

Post the development of agriculture the class system quickly came to be. There are typically 3 classes.

  #### The Ruling Class

  The ruling class have an extreme amount of wealth and power. They are largely in control of the society.

  #### The Middle Class

  The middle class have a moderate amount of wealth and power which allows them to live very comfortably. The attain this by being of use to the ruling class and supporting their rule against the working class.

  #### The Working Class

  The working class have a low amount of wealth and power and make up the majority of society.

Ultimately the class based system is a system of domination by a small group of people who are the rulers. It became possible once agriculture enabled wealth accumulation. The progression looks like this:

* We can accumulate wealth.
* Somehow someone or some group of people accumulate more wealth and thus power than others.
* This greater amount of wealth and power allows them to manipulate the society for their own gain (political power).
* This manipulation which favors them leads to them becoming even wealthier and more powerful (go to previous step)

This process snowballs until you have extremely powerful rulers.

The challenge the ruling class has is that as they become increasingly powerful (and others become less powerful) there is more chance of those beneath them getting fed up and revolting. As such they need propaganda, which the middle class greatly assists with, to control the working class. This propaganda can take a few forms:

* The rulers are special. Holy, ordained, superhuman, chosen by God, etc.
* Create the illusion that the current distribution is actually just.
* Those in power are too powerful and can never be resisted.

### Democratic Capitalism

How does DC fit into all this? Is it a new beast?

No DC is is simply the newest iteration of the class system. It is unique only in that it is the most sophisticated version that has ever existed.

  ### The Ruling Class

  The ruling class are typically not politicians although they can be members. The ruling class are the extremely wealthy individuals in society. There are some extremely wealthy individuals who do not use their power to rule, but they are the exception.

  How do they 'rule'?

  Unlike previous iterations of the class system in DC the ruling class do not need to rule as such. They can satisfy their human selfish urge by amassing wealth and power in ever increasing amounts. They 'rule' only insofar as it helps them increase their wealth. This is done through largely legal means via the [lobbying system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying). Primarily they make political campaign donations or find legal means to bribe political figures to make policy that favors them.

  ### The Middle Class
