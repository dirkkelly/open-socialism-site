title: 'Status Of Open Socialism'

## General Status

Initial Draft.

### The System Status

The system is pretty well designed at a high level at this point. Mostly it needs to be fleshed out further by looking at data on various things.

Particular parts can be further developed by experts in those areas (eg. schooling) but this isn't necessary for the initial release and development of the system.

### Language Status

The language used to define OS conveys the information well enough but it is not well written in a flowing language sense or in a be persuasive to the reader sense.

### Evidence Status

There is some supporting evidence provided for the arguments in the system but much more is needed. The system needs to be informational to those that are open to it, but also convincing to those that don't buy into the arguments.

### Illustrative Pictures

There are no illustrative pictures at this point which would help with conveying information for example the inefficiency of segmenting society into self interested pockets.

## Current Milestone

Get some initial feedback on the basics of the system to fix any obvious problems.

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to reach a level that is ready for public consumption and feedback.

* The initial entry into the system should be very streamlined, visual and persuasive.
* There needs to be more facts backing up the arguments made (or obviously the arguments adjusted if that facts don't match).
* Generally it needs to appear much more professional.

Having said that it's better to go to this step sooner rather than later because feedback and possibly help from others will produce this result.
