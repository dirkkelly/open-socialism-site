## tl;dr of the tl;dr

Democratic capitalism (DC) had some good years and achieved a lot, but it has started to be highly inequitable and exploitative. With modern technology, science and advances in project/team management, many of which we learn about in our jobs as software people, we can create much better systems. We can create a cooperative system that is much more equitable and productive than DC.

## Democratic capitalism (DC) not so good

Note, DC (primarily capitalism) is the dominant system in control of our global society so it is valid to look at it at a global level.

* DC is performing really poorly in terms of being equitable. [The wealthiest 1% in the world have more wealth than the bottom 99%. The wealthiest 62 people have as much wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion](http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/an-economy-for-the-1-how-privilege-and-power-in-the-economy-drive-extreme-inequ-592643){:target="_blank"}.
* Numbers like this are startling but still hard to appreciate. [Check out this graph for family wealth in the US](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51846){:target="_blank"} (significantly less inequality than at a global level though).
* DC is damaging the environment. Worst example, [Elon Musk sums up the global warming issue really well and talks about how 97% of scientists believe the transition to sustainable energy will be catastrophic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCuDxpccYM){:target="_blank"}. Another example, [We are expending the resouces of 1.6 planets per year](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/world_footprint/){:target="_blank"}.
* DC as a system is about 300 years old. Can't we do better with the explosion of modern technology and science?

## Software people are in a great position to design a new system

* We work at the forefront of team, project and (work) culture development including developments such as Agile and the open source model.
* We understand technology and what kind of system through technology is possible.
* We are great at being objective and not being caught up in the zealotry that is coupled with the classical systems of capitalism, communism etc.
* We are great at thinking about greenfield approaches which is a large part of our work.
* We have very specific knowledge of the particular domains (eg. automotive, financial) that we work in so we can reason about more than just software.
* We know excellent tools and processes to collaborate and work on a new system.

## Although, software people are the least likely to think about this

* We are living the capitalism dream. We worked hard in school, probably went to college, got a job in IT, worked hard and are paid handsomely. We tend to love our jobs and profession.
* However, becoming sofware people was likely only possible because we grew up in a middle class family and were able to focus on our study, not the problems with our young lives.
* We also have hit the supply and demand jackpot in terms of our skill set and get pampered and paid way out of proportion to our actual benefit to society (which in many cases will be a net negative).

## What is a good new system then?

* Look at a company like Google. It has no bias to any particular system. Are positions within the company decided by democratic voting? Is everyone given a share of the companies resources and they compete against each other to make money for the company?
* No, primarily people are all working together towards common goals. There are elements of competition and voting in certain areas, but these are tools applied only when and where it makes sense, not as the underlying system.
* This is because the most efficient way for humans to be productive is to cooperate, which isn't suprising given we evolved to operate cooperatively in a tribe. [More info on the inefficiency of the free market](https://opensocialism.com/open-socialism/arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).
* The main argument against cooperative systems at a societal level is it won't work because people will become corrupt. However, this is a solvable problem.
* Much like open source, all information both in real time and historical can be made available on the internet meaning corruption needs to happen under the nose of the entirety of society.
* The [consensus seeking model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) of decision making can be used to make corrupting a decision requiring corrupting the majority of a committee which is much more difficult than corrupting an individual leader.
