## tl;dr of the tl;dr

Democratic capitalism (DC) had some good years and achieved a lot, but it has started to be highly inequitable and exploitative. With modern technology, science and project/team management, many of which we learn about in our jobs as software people we can create much better systems. We can create a cooperative system that is much more equitable and productive than DC.

## Democratic capitalism (DC) not so good

* DC is performing really poorly in terms of being equitable. [The wealthiest 1% in the world have more wealth than the bottom 99%. The wealthiest 62 people have as much wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion.](http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/an-economy-for-the-1-how-privilege-and-power-in-the-economy-drive-extreme-inequ-592643){:target="_blank"}.
* DC is damaging the environment. Worst example, [Elon Musk sums this up really well and talks about how 97% of scientists believe the transition to sustainable energy will the catastroptic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCuDxpccYM){:target="_blank"}.
* DC as a system is about 300 years old. Can't we do better with the explosion of modern technology and science?

## Software people are in a great position to design a new system

* We work at the forefront of team, project and culture development including developments such as Agile and the open source model.
* We understand technology and what kind of system through technology is possible.
* We are great at being objective and not being caught up in the zealotry that is coupled with the classical systems of capitalism, communism etc.
* We are great at thinking about greenfield approaches.
* We know excellent tools and processes to collaborate and work on a new system.

## Although, software people are the least likely to think about this

* We are living the capitalist dream. We worked hard in school, probably went to college, got a job in IT, worked hard and are paid handsomely.
* However, in reality this was likely only possible because we grew up in a middle class family and were able to focus on our study, not the problems with our young lives.
* We also have hit the supply and demand jackpot and get pampered and paid well way out of proportion to our actual benefit to society.

## What is a good new system then?

* Look at a company like Google. It has no bias to any particular system. It primarily works on a cooperative system. There may be elements of democracy or capitalism added here and there, but these are uncommon.
* [This is because a cooperative system is inherently far more efficient](https://opensocialism.com/open-socialism/arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).
* The main argument is the cooperative system won't work because people will become corrupt when this is applied to the whole of a society. However, this is a solvable problem.
* Much like open source, all information both in real time and historical can be made available on the internet meaning corruption needs to happen under the nose of the entirety of society.
* The [conensus seeking model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) of decision making can be used to make corrupting a decision requiring corrupting the majority of a committee which is much more difficult.
