## What is 'Open Socialism'?

Open Socialism is a system that is designed to be the most equitable and productive societal system given our current level of scientific and technological advancement.

Before we get into the specifics, let's look at the history of human societies and look at the recurring problems. Let's in particular look at democratic capitalism (DC) and show that whilst it has achieved a lot and it does have good parts, it is not terribly different from systems that have come before it that favor a ruling class. Let's then look into how we can take the good parts from DC and a variety of other systems and create a societal system that is far better for the vast majority of the population.

## A History of Human Societies

### The Nomadic Tribe

About 200,000 years ago modern humans evolved from primates.

Humans lived in nomadic tribes. Everyone basically had the same job of hunting and gathering. Whilst some individuals might be leadership figures of a tribe they did not dominate others in the tribe and each individual got a relatively even share of the tribes resources.

Tribes were closely bonded kin and each individual had a strong sense of belonging and community in their tribe. This is because tribes that worked together and cooperated were selected via the process of natural selection.

It is important to note that physiologically we have not significantly changed from those humans of old. We are still the same humans that if raised in a tribe would fit perfectly into it. This is a society in which our natural instincts and ways of organizing ourselves suit the environment perfectly. There is leadership based on merit, small wealth and power inequality and a strong sense of community. In a sense it is the perfect society for us, however it is not feasible on a global scale at the level of population the earth now has.

### Agricultural Societies

7000 years ago agriculture was achieved which greatly changed human societies. For the first time humans had the the ability to stay in one place as they could utilize the land efficiently enough to produce sufficient food for everyone. Agriculture also meant that not everyone had to focus on the necessities of survival since the farmers could produce a great amount of food. This meant that other more specialized forms of technology development and wealth generation could exist. For the first time significant wealth generation and accumulation was possible.

As technology advanced and the ability to accumulate wealth increased leaders rose to the top. We progressed to the system of society that has been recurring throughout history.

### The Domination Structure

The domination structure has 3 classes. The ruling class, the middle class and the working class.

* The ruling class has extreme wealth and power and are able to exert power over other members of society.
* The middle class have moderate wealth which they maintain by serving the ruling class in dominating the working class. * The working class produce the basic goods of society which largely go to the ruling class. They do not have power over their own destiny.

Through all the post agricultural societies this pattern has been repeated despite the fact that it only greatly benefits a small percentage of the population.

#### How does the domination structure persist?

The ruling class cannot dominate through force of violence alone as they are a small percentage of the population. Thus to stay in power they need propaganda to maintain the current structure. For example:

* The rulers are special. Holy, ordained, superhuman, chosen by God, etc.
* Create the illusion that the current distribution is actually just.
* Those in power are tool powerful and can never be resisted.

## Let's look more at Democratic Capitalism

DC is most recent iteration of the domination structure. It functions in the same fundamental way as all the previous post agricultural societies.

### The classes in DC

* The ruling class - these are generally not politicians but are the super rich, the top 1% that have the ability to greatly influence politics for their own gain.
* The middle class - these are politicians, small business owners and skilled laborers. They all have a modest amount of wealth and want to maintain the current structure for this.
* The working class - these are the large number of unskilled laborers. They get a much smaller percentage of the wealth their work generates and generally have to work harder since they compete with a large number of other unskilled laborers.

### The propaganda of DC

The propaganda of DC is interesting in that it is the most complex that has been seen.

##### DC is fair and equitable. Anyone can through work become rich and each individual has freedom and equal rights.

Fundamental to DC propaganda is everyone is equal and the notion of freedom. Let's look into those.

##### Equality

In DC it is true that everyone has equal rights and is subject to the same laws. However, the reality of what is actually attainable by an individual of the ruling class and the working class is quite different. A member of the ruling class, through wealth has the right to superior education, health, legal rights, etc. Anything that a working class member has a right to, a ruling class member has a right to a better version of it.

To generalize, 'Equal rights to all (assuming you have a boat load of money)'.

##### Freedom

Everyone is free in DC to do whatever they want. However, those not already a member of the ruling class need to feed, clothe and houses themselves so whilst they are free, they must work for the ruling class. In doing so they generate more wealth for the ruling class than they themselves receive. They are free to choose which particular member of the ruling class they will generate wealth for and to certain degree what kind of work that will entail. You are not free when going down this path to directly benefit proportionally to the wealth you produce.

The other option available is to attempt to become one of the ruling or middle class by starting a business. Firstly it is worth noting that it is much rarer for the working class to do this. They lack the education of the ruling and middle class to be able to see the system that they live in and find a niche for a business to exploit. They also lack the wealth to go down an initially highly unprofitable path. 'Anyone can start a business and become rich' boils down to 'Those that are already relatively rich can gamble to become more rich'.

The option of starting a business is also a large gamble, especially if the individual don't already have a nest egg of wealth. They will likely either make it and make a considerable amount of money, or the business will fail and they will be worse off as they need to pay back the debts they accumulated.

To generalize, everyone is free to choose any number of bad options for how they work.

#### The worst system, except for all the others

'DC has wealth inequality but it's DC or a dictatorship eg communism, socialism'. DC (which is to say the ruling class of DC) was greatly afraid of communism and has seen the need to invade or provide military assistance to many countries over the years to combat it such as Vietnam. The propaganda of the red communists is quite a famous example. This propaganda is quite clear to us as hysterical when viewed through the lens of history.

It's true that communism and other alternative systems of society have all devolved into domination structures however DC is also a domination structure. 'DC isn't that bad' isn't a reason not to keep trying to find a system that is much better or to not try and improve DC itself.

Communism, socialism and others all have a lot of potential. They classically failed (like DC) due to corruption but this is an addressable problem. There is nothing inherently broken about the systems themselves.

Capitalism itself is actually only kept in check by socialistic elements. During early capitalism and industrial times for example in [1819 there was a law passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mills_and_Factories_Act_1819) that prevent children of 8 or under working in factories and children of 9-16 years working for no more than 12 hours. This was the improvement to the existing situation that was occurring with unrestrained capitalism.

It's also worth nothing that capitalism and democracy are 300 years old.  Are we saying that in 300 years of development including explosion of modern technology this very old system is essentially the best conceivable? Also modern DC is very UNdemocratic and UNcapitalistic. For example a huge amount of money and technology that goes into large corporations comes from governments which is totally counter to the concept of the free market (although I would argue that DC regardless of how well it starts will in time fall into a system like we have as unlimited wealth accumulation will eventually lead to political influence and it's a slippery slope from there).

Other systems are possible and stating otherwise is propaganda to maintain the current power structure.

### DC is not focused on dealing with the domination structures

The domination structure has been THE problem of every post agricultural society. Despite this DC is simply not focused on providing an equitable wealth and power distribution.

DC is primarily focused on motivating people to work and ideally increasing the overall wealth of society. Secondarily democracy has principles to avoid corruption but extreme wealth/power centralization overrides the principle of a 'government for the people' since the rich can wield so much political power. This problem starts small at first but snowballs as political influence of the rich allows them to get more wealth and thus more political influence and so on.

### Why does everyone just settle on DC?

Surely it is possible to design a society that has a primary focus of limiting corruption and extreme power centralization as a core goal, using modern knowledge and technology. However, why is this kind of discussion largely not going on? What we do have is activism around dealing with symptoms of DC but even those people seem to just accept that DC is still the best system but that human corruption is the actual problem, despite human corruption being the norm throughout history. Why do people not look at the underlying system as a culprit?

A better system can be designed!

## What should a new system focus on?

### Ok so the most important thing to deal with is corruption (and the domination structure)

* Extreme wealth inequality will almost always lead to political influence so there shouldn't be mechanisms that allow this. In other words there should be no free enterprise or this will eventually occur.
* At higher levels of society decisions should be made by groups of leaders, not individuals. It is much harder to corrupt the majority of a group as opposed to an individual.
* Wherever possible information and decision making should be completely open and available on the internet. Anyone can see the basis for any decision and flag anything they disagree with or that seems like it could involve corruption.
* There should be AI programs that analyze data around decision making and check for patterns that indicate bias or corruption. AI programs can also analyze banks accounts and transactions to look for suspicious activity that could indicate corruption.

### At the same time, there needs to be reward for effort

* Rising up in society and doing more critical work for society should result in monetary rewards (as well as prestige) just that these rewards should not be tremendously greater than than a lesser worker
* There should be monetary or [gamified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) rewards for additional assistance to society such as proposing ideas to different parts of society that are used.

### General equality should be a core goal

* Everyone should get a base salary, even if unemployed, that is enough to live off of
* All education and health care should be free
* All legal matters should not be influenced by wealth

### There needs to be a strong sense of community

* Technology to assist with people associating with others that they have things in common with such as interests, location, profession and so on.
* More local community cooperation and activities. People should live in tribes and those that you live around should be known and work together on a local level.

### There should be a heavy focus on long term thinking

* The environment should be looked after carefully.
* There should be a heavy and continual investment in science and technology.
* There should be a focus on spreading humanity out from Earth so the species will survive a cataclysmic event occuring to our home planet.
* The societal system should be made to improve over time, not get stuck in a situation that is not beneficial for the majority.

### The well being and happiness of the people is very important

* Happiness is important. Unhappy people are less productive and even what is the point of adopting a system if everyone is miserable all the time?
* There should be continual scientific study into how we can remain satisfied at a basic level in a world with constantly evolving technology.

## Conclusion

Humans have come from a society that we were perfectly suited to. From there we have had had a series of domination based societies, democratic capitalism being no different. New and better societies ARE possible and Open Socialism IS a compelling option.
