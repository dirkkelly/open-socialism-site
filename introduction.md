## What is 'Open Socialism'?

Open Socialism is a system that is designed to be the most equitable and productive societal system given our current level of scientific and technological advancement.

Before we get into the specifics, let's look at the history of human societies and look at the recurring problems. Let's in particular look at Democratic Capitalism (DC) and show that whilst it has achieved a lot and it does have good parts, it is not terribly different from systems that have come before it that favor a ruling class. Let's then look into how we can take the good parts from DC and a variety of other systems and create a societal system that is far better for the vast majority of the population.

## A History of Human Societies

### The Nomadic Tribe

About 200,000 years ago modern humans evolved from primates.

Humans lived in nomadic tribes. Everyone basically had the same job of hunting and gathering. Whilst some individuals might be leadership figures of a tribe they did not dominate others in the tribe and each individual got a relatively even share of the tribes resources.

Tribes were closely bonded kin and each individual had a strong sense of belonging and community in their tribe. This is because tribes that worked together and cooperated were selected via the process of natural selection.

It is important to note that physiologically we have not significantly changed from those humans of old. We are still the same humans that if raised in a tribe would fit perfectly into it. This is a society in which our natural instincts and ways of organizing ourselves suit the environment perfectly. There is leadership based on merit, small wealth and power inequality and a strong sense of community. In a sense it is the perfect society for us, however it is not feasible on a global scale at the level of population the earth now has.

Why do such societies so perfectly fit our psychology? The main reason is our own self interest almost perfectly aligns with the interest of our tribe. If in this environment we took a capitalistic approach and hoarded our own food we would be shunned and expelled (or worse). A bunch of humans working for themselves is less productive than humans working together (and by extension for themselves at the same). Being valuable to your tribe, providing good leadership, all these things help yourself and your tribe at the same time. This is why the tribal system is so good and why our ancestors who worked together were selected by natural selection.

Not only is this working together more effective, it is also hard wired into our psychology and cooperation, belonging to a tribe is tremendously satisfying and ultimately a strong need of ours.

### Agricultural Societies

7000 years ago agriculture was achieved which greatly changed human societies. Firstly lets note that this is only in the last 3.5% of human history. The prior 96.5% was the tribal cooperative system.

For the first time humans had the the ability to stay in one place as they could utilize the land efficiently enough to produce sufficient food for everyone. Agriculture also meant that not everyone had to focus on the necessities of survival since the farmers could produce a great amount of food. This meant that other more specialized forms of technological development and wealth generation could exist. For the first time significant wealth generation and accumulation was possible.

As technology advanced and the ability to accumulate wealth increased leaders rose to the top. We progressed to the system of society that has been recurring throughout history with different classes including a ruling class.

The reason this happened is that humans are actually self interested above all else. Humans that have not favored themselves primarily have not been selected by evolution since this kind of selfishness greatly increases the chance of an individuals genes being passed on. However, pre-agriculture it wasn't a problem as there was only so much room for selfishness. We pretty much had to be highly cooperative with the tribe or we risk being ostracized which likely means death. The wiggle room was being more prominent in the tribe and attracting mates. If a member can be selfish in these ways then that is acceptable (and the competition and striving is actually good for the tribe anyway).

Since agriculture and commerce the tribal system collapsed and we were suddenly living with a new system. For the first time an individual could be greatly selfish and not only not get ostracized but could prosper, be celebrated, become powerful and be a ruler of society. This is the same humans exercising the same selfishness. The difference is that the system of society had changed and the natural urge for selfishness was no longer held in check by the nature of a tribal society and also by necessity (a tribe of selfish members was not strong enough to survive).

However, the selfish system of individuals is less productive, less satisfying and is analogous to candy. Similarly to how when our environment limits our intake of sweets and survival is tough sweet foods are great because they have a lot of energy. Although nowadays we have endless access to cheap candy and struggle to fight our instincts to over consume. The tribal environment no longer exists and our selfish instincts hurt us (as we become lonely loners) and hurt society with decreased productivity.

One core metric of a society is to what degree does selfish human behavior coincide with the greater good. The tribal system was almost perfect. Since then there hasn't been a society that has been remotely close. What we have had since then is the class based system.

### The Class System

Post the development of agriculture the class system quickly came to be. There are typically 3 classes.

#### The Ruling Class

The ruling class have an extreme amount of wealth and power. They are largely in control of the society.

#### The Middle Class

The middle class have a moderate amount of wealth and power which allows them to live very comfortably. They attain this by being of use to the ruling class and supporting their rule against the working class.

#### The Working Class

The working class have a low amount of wealth and power and make up the majority of society.

Ultimately the class based system is a system of domination by a small group of people who are the rulers. It became possible once agriculture enabled wealth accumulation. The progression looks like this:

* We can accumulate wealth.
* Somehow someone or some group of people accumulate more wealth and thus power than others.
* This greater amount of wealth and power allows them to manipulate the society for their own gain (political power).
* This manipulation which favors them leads to them becoming even wealthier and more powerful (go to previous step)

This process snowballs until you have extremely powerful rulers.

The challenge the ruling class has is that as they become increasingly powerful (and others become less powerful) there is more chance of those beneath them getting fed up and revolting. As such they need propaganda, which the middle class greatly assists with, to control the working class. This propaganda can take a few forms:

* The rulers are special. Holy, ordained, superhuman, chosen by God, etc.
* Create the illusion that the current distribution is actually just.
* Those in power are too powerful and can never be resisted.

### Democratic Capitalism

How does DC fit into all this? Is it a new beast?

No DC is is simply the newest iteration of the class system. It is unique only in that it is the most sophisticated version that has ever existed.

#### The Ruling Class

The ruling class are typically not politicians although they can be members. The ruling class are the extremely wealthy individuals in society. There are some extremely wealthy individuals who do not use their power to rule, but they are the exception.

How do they 'rule'?

Unlike previous iterations of the class system in DC the ruling class do not need to rule as such. They can satisfy their human selfish urge by amassing wealth and power in ever increasing amounts. They 'rule' only insofar as it helps them increase their wealth. This is done through largely legal means via the [lobbying system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying){:target="_blank"}. Primarily they make political campaign donations or find legal means to bribe political figures to make policy that favors them.

#### The Middle Class

The middle class in DC have many facets. First and foremost they are politicians. The politicians assist the ruling class by helping them increase their wealth and power and controlling the working class.

They are also made up of medium sized business owners. There are those who provide services to the companies of the ruling class (that are cheaper and better value than those that came before) and thus assist them for a portion of their wealth and power. Although, there are entrepreneurs who sometimes create businesses that service the middle or working class which largely sit outside the class based system in that they don't serve the ruling class, unless they become rich enough to exert political influence for their own gain and become a member of the ruling class.

There are also skilled laborers who work for the ruling class, or companies that serve the ruling class. They in return for their service (creating more wealth for the ruling class) get a portion of the wealth they create, which due to the huge amount of wealth the ruling class has can be sizable depending on the supply and demand equation and their skill.

#### The Working Class

The working class are unskilled laborers and includes the unemployed and homeless. They can either work for the ruling class for a much lower portion of the wealth they create when compared to the skilled middle class laborer, or they can not work and live in abject poverty.

#### The propaganda of DC

The propaganda of DC is interesting in that it is the most complex that has existed.

##### DC is fair and equitable. Anyone can through work become rich and each individual has freedom and equal rights.

Fundamental to DC propaganda is everyone is equal and the notion of freedom. Let's look into those.

##### Equality

In DC it is true that everyone has equal rights and is subject to the same laws. However, the reality of what is actually attainable by an individual of the ruling class and the working class is quite different. A member of the ruling class, through wealth has the right to superior education, health, legal rights, etc. Anything that a working class member has a right to, a ruling class member has a right to a better version of it.

To generalize, 'Equal rights to all (assuming you have a large amount of wealth)'.

##### Freedom

Everyone is free in DC to do whatever they want. However, those not already a member of the ruling class need to feed, clothe and houses themselves so whilst they are 'free', they must work for the ruling class. In doing so they generate much more wealth for the ruling class than they themselves receive. They are free to choose which particular member of the ruling class they will generate wealth for and to a certain degree what kind of work that will entail. You are not free when going down this path to directly benefit proportionally to the wealth you produce.

The other option available is to attempt to become one of the ruling or middle class by starting a business. Firstly it is worth noting that it is much rarer for the working class to do this. They lack the education of the ruling and middle class to be able to see the system that they live in and find a niche for a business to exploit. They also lack the wealth to go down an initially highly unprofitable path. 'Anyone can start a business and become rich' boils down to 'Those that are already relatively rich can gamble to become more rich'.

The option of starting a business is also risky, especially if the individual doesn't already have a nest egg of wealth. They will likely either make it and make a considerable amount of money, or the business will fail and they will be worse off as they need to pay back the debts they accumulated.

To generalize, everyone is free to choose any number of bad options for how they work.

##### The worst system, except for all the others

'DC has wealth inequality but it's DC or a dictatorship eg. communism, socialism which has failed time and again'. DC (which is to say the ruling class of DC) was greatly afraid of communism and has seen the need to invade or provide military assistance to many countries over the years to combat it such as Vietnam. The propaganda of the red communists is quite a famous example. This propaganda is quite clear to us as hysterical when viewed through the lens of history.

It's true that communism and other alternative systems of society have all devolved into the class system however DC is also an example of the class system so it's a moot point.

It can be argued that DC is the best iteration of the class system, but this doesn't mean that a new system that is not a class system isn't feasible. Or at least it doesn't mean that DC can't be modified to be less class based.

In fact communism, socialism (and many others such as  [cooperative businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative){:target="_blank"}) are certainly feasible. They have only traditionally failed because like DC the core problem of human selfishness which leads to the class system was not the primary issue being addressed. Or because they were in fact dictatorships wearing the name of communism or socialism.

Capitalism itself is actually only kept in check by socialistic elements. During early capitalism and industrial times for example in [1819 there was a law passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mills_and_Factories_Act_1819){:target="_blank"} that prevented children of 8 or under working in factories and children of 9-16 years working for no more than 12 hours. Children under 8 working in factories is what unrestrained capitalism looks like.

It's also worth nothing that capitalism and democracy are 300 years old.  Are we saying that in 300 years of development including the explosion of modern technology this very old system is essentially the best conceivable?

Also modern DC is very UNdemocratic and UNcapitalistic. Using wealth and power for political influence is the antithesis of democracy and the free market (capitalism). 'The current system is the best and only one possible' is overly simplistic. There are many people who simple want to fix DC by moving to more democracy and capitalism. Point being the current iteration of DC is certainly not the be all and end all of societal systems!

## The Problem To Solve

Humans are selfish. This selfishness when there is a large amount of wealth being created will naturally lead to the class system. This system benefits a small percentage of the population and is greatly less productive than a cooperative system.

A system is needed that:

* like the tribal system, aligns self interest with the greater good
* is cooperative as this is more productive (and good for our psychology)
* is sustainable in the long term
* ensures the survival of the society

Put simply, humans should be being selfish in ways that increase the chance of their genes being passed on but at the same time  that are cooperative and benefit society as a whole.

DC has failed because self interest largely just benefits the self, often at the expense of others. Communism and socialism have failed because they assumed that humans are inherently 'good' and in the right environment, with the right humans they won't be selfish at all.

## A Naive Solution

Commonly when people notice the issues of DC and propose solutions they still start with DC as a base, then layer on top more socialistic principles. Unfortunately when the base is DC which inherently based on selfish behavior that does not benefit the whole and naturally leads to the class system, it is extremely difficult and wasteful to then attempt to temper that with socialism. For example you can add more regulation and taxation on wealthy corporations and individuals, however this results in an arms race to avoid these measures by the ruling class. A large amount of resources is spent in this fight as loopholes are discovered and closed progressively. It also devolves into a rigged competiton as democracy allows for the rulling class to exert political influence and keep their loopholes.

## A Solution

Open Socialism is a solution to the problem stated above that starts with an idealistic base that is cooperative (socialism/communism).

Communism and socialism were close to being a viable solution in that they were at least cooperative, with everyone working together for the greater good, similar to the tribal system. However, they assumed that humans could be unselfish.

Whilst we as individuals don't particularly have the ability to suddenly not be selfish. We do have powerful brains and we have the ability to create systems that don't require humans to be unselfish.

In fact two simple additions are all that is required to make communism/socialism work in such a way. This is far less effort than the complexity of mitigating the inherent issues of DC.

### Prevent Corruption

Corruption is selfishness that benefits oneself only and likely hurts other people. This is the corruption that has existed since agriculture.

Here are some solutions:

* Extreme wealth inequality will almost always lead to political influence so there shouldn't be mechanisms that allow this. In other words there should be no free enterprise or this will eventually occur.
* At higher levels of society decisions should be made by groups of leaders, not individuals. It is much harder to corrupt the majority of a group as opposed to an individual.
* Wherever possible information and decision making should be completely open and available on the internet. Anyone can see the basis for any decision and flag anything they disagree with or that seems like it could involve corruption.
* There should be AI programs that analyze data around decision making and check for patterns that indicate bias or corruption. AI programs can also analyze banks accounts and transactions to look for suspicious activity that could indicate corruption.

### Reward Selfish Striving

* Rising up in society and doing more critical work for society should result in monetary rewards (as well as prestige). The monetary rewards don't need to be extreme to being a leader of society a desirable goal.
* There should be monetary or [gamified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification){:target="_blank"} rewards for additional assistance to society such as proposing ideas to different parts of society that are used or types of volunteer work.

By preventing corruption and rewarding individual effort a cooperative system that aligns with our psychology, much like the tribal system, is possible. Such a system can be set up that directly focuses on these core societal problems and gets better and better at dealing with them. This is a continual challenge as technology changes and human selfishness threatens corruption creeping in. Thankfully we have the intelligence and the technology to address these problems if we can just recognize them for what they are.

There is a lot more to Open Socialism than this, but this is the foundational concept that can enable a highly productive and fulfilling society that benefits everyone.
