## What is 'Open Socialism'?

Open Socialism (OS) is a rethink of how to manage a society. It starts with an *optimistic* base concept that focuses on broad scale cooperation, but then layers on processes and ideas to keep people motivated and prevent corruption. It looks at human nature through the lens of our evolution and attempts to recapture the good parts of a tribal society, but in a way that can work on a grand scale. It borrows heavily from modern team and culture management, in paricular [the open source model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model){:target="_blank"}.

Before getting into the specifics let's look at some attributes of a tribal society.

## The Tribal Model

Humans evovled to operate in small nomadic tribes. This model has existed for approximately 195,000 years and can be considered as humans *natural habitat*.

Let's look at some of the attributes of tribes.

* Strong sense of community
* Heavy cooperation
* Limited power and wealth inequality
* Meritocracy

All these attributes are important. We have evolved to operate in such a way. However, what is the key difference between the tribal model and the systems we have had since then?

### Wealth accumulation is not possible

In the tribal model the maximum wealth and power attainable is to rule the tribe. This can only be achieved through clear and ongoing merit. The leader of the tribe may get the best share of the food, the best place to sleep and the choice of tools and clothing but beyond this no more wealth or power can be attained.

#### Contrasts

In newer systems initial wealth and power may be aquired through merit and providing value to everyone, but from there wealth and power snowballs. Eg. a wealthy person can leverage their wealth to corrupt others to gain more wealth and power. Their children in turn will recieve an unfair advantage, even through they may lack the merit to be leaders.

### Self interest is directly aligned with the good of the tribe

To be successful one needs to be valuable to the tribe. Leaders would be selected by their intelligence or strength. Providing this value to the tribe helps one be attractive and be selected as a mate.

#### Contrasts

In newer systems self interest sometimes cooincides with the good of the group but often does not. Making money often involves manipulating others or exploiting the weak. The more money one accumulates the less their labor seems to benefit others.

### The Tribal Model Conclusion

Reasonable wealth and power inequality based on merit is OK and humans naturally organise this way. Accumulation beyond this is counter productive and leads to extreme and unmerited power centralisation and corruption.

A key metric of a society is to what degree does self interested behaviour cooincide with the good of the group. A more deliberate and organised society, focused on the greater good, like the tribal model may be possible.

It's also worth noting that we often overstate the selfish nature of humans. Humans are social cooperative animals who live in groups. Societal systems based on cooperation are not alien to us.

## A Cooperative Base System

What does a cooperative base system mean? What are some of the benefits? What are some of the issues?

In essence it means that people primarily work together for the greater good of the group. There may be elements of competition and selfishness, but these are not the primary mode of operation.

### What are the benefits?

A cooperative system means that through leadership a group can have a directed purpose. For example a tribe can decide to migrate if food is depleting in their current area. This isn't possible with systems that have everyone working to their own self interest.

The modern example is climate change, where it is clearly to the groups interest to greatly limit C02 emissions and halt climate change, but executing this is not possible.

The other obvious benefit is a large amount of resources is not wasted through competition. For example in capitalism companies spend a large amount of marketing, legal battles and also each invent similar technology in isolation.

For a multitude of reasons, at least on paper, a cooperative system is more efficient and effective.

### What are the issues?

Since the tribal system, cooperative systems have not been stable. Notably communism has either completely destabalised or been largely ineffective. If a cooperative system is better on paper why have they not been successful?

Communism has failed for the same reasons that capitalism has been a mixed bag.

#### Wealth / power accumulation is possible

Communism has ideals of limiting wealth and power accumulation, however it turns out this is an exceptionally difficult to implement. Humans will naturally seek advantage for themselves and a system designed to limit that needs to be water tight. If not corruption and inequality will snowball and society will suffer.

#### Self interest is aligned to the benefit of the group

Communism on paper beautifully aligns self interest with the good of the group. However, if corruption and inequality have snowballed, the means of raising your own wealth is no longer about providing value to the group, but provding value to the corrupt and powerful people.

#### Limited motivation to excel

Communism has another large issue in that it has not greatly incentivized excelence. The rewards for great work have not been sufficient to the individual and so progress has typically languished.

## A cooperative system without the downsides?
