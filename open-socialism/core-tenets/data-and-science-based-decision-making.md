title: 'Data And Science Based Decision Making'
---

It is easy to sometimes get swept up in emotion and then make biased decisions. This is error prone and not an accountable form of decision making. Data and science based decision making is more reliable.

Counter point: Does instinct / gut based decision making have a place somewhere (such as the [Blink! book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(book)){:target="_blank"})?
