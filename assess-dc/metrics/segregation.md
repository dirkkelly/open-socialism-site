DC generally isn't too bad with this as everyone has equal rights, so there isn't direct, forced segregation.

However, DC has large wealth inequality which creates a class system and those different classes tend not to mix. Certain races also tend to be members of poorer or wealthier classes so you can see that compound segregation and prejudice.
