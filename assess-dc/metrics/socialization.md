title: 'Socialization'
---

For DC socialization is decreasing as technology advances. These are making people less happy overall as humans are living in increasingly unnatural environments where they can look to the internet to satisfy themselves socially, but whilst this can be addictive it doesn't really satisfy. The problem is that capitalism will sell people products regardless of whether it is good for them or not. People will buy products if they provide them instant gratification regardless of whether that is good for them or not. This leads to products and usage patterns that can be damaging to individuals and cause them to not seek out the level of socialization that they need.

There is also less incentive to do research on these kind of issues because that can only decrease sales.
